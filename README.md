  <p>The long term objective is to make a difference in my community through the creation of innovative social projects using software development and by applying collaboration and connectivity. Motivated for a change in career path to become a software engineer. Developing coding skills at an accelerated pace.</p>
    <p>Born and bred in London, itâ€™s time to give back to my community. A decade of civil service in providing employment support to people in low socio-economic areas of London has allowed significant development of soft skills by delivering empathetic and compassionate communication.</p>
    <p>Identifying that technology has a huge impact on our current lives, thus I have decided to take a new direction into technology, particularly programming. Since we are an increasingly technologically reliant society, means coding is now an essential skill for a human being. 
I want to be able to make a difference in the community e.g. application or website development aiding local businesses to thrive. Otherwise, be part of huge social projects to make a difference in the world. For example how can we solve the ever growing demands on the NHS due to increasing population and complex comorbidities. Currently Babylon ltd is in the process of using artificial intelligence to contribute in solving this issue. </p>
    <p>The idea of being part of a larger group of highly functioning programmers for development of new and exciting software significantly plays to my natural aptitude for working effectively with others. Coordinating with various coding minds allows for different perspectives on a project thus generating unique and cutting edge software.</p>
